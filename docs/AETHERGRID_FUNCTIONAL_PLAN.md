# ÆTHERGRID Functional Workspaces Plan

ÆTHERGRID is being developed as a real operator application, not a visual mockup. The product must preserve the advisory-only safety boundary while making every operator-facing surface usable, stateful, testable, packageable, and replaceable.

## Product purpose

ÆTHERGRID combines four coordinated capabilities:

1. **GRID** — live digital-twin observation, time-indexed spatial data, asset inspection, telemetry, regions, scenarios and evidence-linked operating state.
2. **HOLOGRAPHIC** — renderer-driven 3D/4D spatial analysis with wireframe topology, layers, camera controls, temporal state and future-state comparison.
3. **QUANTUM** — bounded optimization lab with explicit objectives, constraints, classical comparison, run history and evidence receipts.
4. **AI** — replaceable specialized agents that can work independently or as a team without becoming authoritative grid truth.
5. **EVIDENCE** — provenance, receipts, exports, audit events and reproducibility.
6. **SETTINGS** — persistent non-secret operator preferences and visible provider/runtime readiness.

## Non-negotiable architecture rules

- No screenshot-backed runtime UI.
- Runtime controls are semantic HTML, SVG, Canvas or WebGL elements.
- x/y/z + time is the maintained 4D spatial model.
- Physical actuation and infrastructure dispatch remain disabled.
- Model output is advisory and cannot silently mutate authoritative twin state.
- Model providers are adapters. Replacing a model must require configuration changes, not UI rewrites.
- Secrets stay server-side and are never serialized to the browser or ZIP manifests.
- Every packaged ZIP must contain all maintained source, app/json manifests, tests/docs needed for review, and a direct-open standalone HTML fallback.
- Backend-connected mode must run from the same ZIP with Node 22.

## Batch plan

Status: COMPLETE

Deliver:
- real workspace router: Grid, Holographic, Quantum, AI, Evidence, Scenarios, Settings;

### Batch 6 — Evidence, scenarios and operator workflow
Status: COMPLETE

Deliver:
- scenario builder;
- scenario duplication/reset;
- evidence browser;
- audit activity timeline;
- filter/search;
- JSON export package;
- operator report data package;
- reproducibility metadata.

### Batch 7 — Packaging, launchers and regression gates
Status: COMPLETE

Deliver:
- Windows PowerShell launcher;
- optional batch launcher;
- generated self-contained standalone HTML;
- complete app ZIP;
- non-empty-file validation;
- provider configuration examples without secrets;
- CI/browser contract tests;
- no-screenshot regression gate;
- SHA-256 inventory.

## Replaceable model contract

Each agent resolves through configuration with this shape:

```json
{
  "id": "VAELON",
  "provider": "openai-compatible",
  "model": "configured-by-env-or-local-config",
  "role": "Optimization & Scenario Exploration",
  "timeoutMs": 45000
}
```

Provider adapters implement a small contract:

- `complete({ agent, messages, context, signal })`
- return text, provider/model identity, latency and usage metadata when supplied by the provider;
- throw typed errors for unavailable credentials, timeouts and malformed responses.

The UI never receives provider secrets.

## Definition of fully functional

A fresh ZIP is considered functional when:

- `node server.mjs` launches the complete application;
- every primary navigation item switches to a distinct usable workspace;
- all visible settings mutate real application behavior and persist;
- Grid/Holographic/Quantum/AI/Evidence/Scenario controls produce real state changes;
- the three agents can run individually;
- team mode produces a multi-agent result and records each contribution;
- model/provider assignments can be replaced from configuration;
- absence of model credentials degrades visibly to deterministic local fallback instead of breaking the app;
- tests, lint, typecheck, coverage, release readiness, package assembly and CodeQL pass;
- the runtime does not depend on the old dashboard screenshot.


## Current branch progress

The current functional-workspaces branch now includes:

- exclusive workspace routing for Grid, Holographic, Quantum, AI, Scenarios, Evidence and Settings;
- persistent non-secret operator settings;
- Windows PowerShell/CMD launchers and app-local provider configuration example;
- native WebGL Grid + independent Holographic renderer;
- Holographic projection, temporal mode, intensity, time and layer controls;
- bounded optimization inputs that affect deterministic classical/experimental comparison results;
- replaceable `local`, `openai-compatible` and `ollama` provider adapters;
- per-agent provider/model overrides;
- real individual-agent endpoints;
- three-agent parallel team orchestration with configurable synthesis provider;
- provider-failure fallback with runtime metadata and SHA-256 receipts;
- model/provider readiness UI that never exposes provider secrets;
- evidence records generated by optimization runs.

Remaining before this roadmap is marked complete:

- richer node picking directly inside the WebGL canvas;
- scenario editing/duplication instead of fixed scenario templates only;
- expanded evidence drill-down with full receipts and agent contribution records;
- final browser regression pass and distributable ZIP verification.


## Batch completion checkpoint

Batches 1–6 are now implemented in the maintained branch.

- Holographic mode has its own WebGL renderer, direct node picking, projection modes, temporal modes, time comparison overlay, saved camera views, layer controls and scene export.
- Quantum mode has real objectives, weighted controls, reserve constraints, deterministic classical-vs-experimental comparison, reliability scoring, history and evidence receipts.
- Scenario mode supports templates, duplication, reset and a bounded custom scenario editor.
- Evidence mode supports filtering, receipt drill-down, provider/model provenance, contribution receipts and a runtime audit timeline.
- AI mode supports replaceable provider/model configuration, individual specialist execution and three-agent team orchestration.

Batch 7 is limited to final release verification: all regression gates must pass at one immutable head commit, the CI-built ZIP must be inspected for required files and zero empty entries, and the verified branch is then merged to main.


## Verified package checkpoint

The CI-built functional application archive was inspected after the final release gates passed:

- 22 regular files;
- 0 empty files;
- includes `standalone.html`, modular HTML/CSS/JS, Node backend, provider-neutral AI runtime, agent config, JSON manifests, brand assets, app-local environment example, PowerShell/CMD launchers, README, file inventory and SHA-256 sums;
- the old dashboard screenshot is not required by the runtime package;
- tests, lint, typecheck, coverage, fresh-clone smoke, container smoke, quality/release-readiness and CodeQL are required before merge.

## Batch 8 — Global intelligence, operator identity, and external compute

Status: IMPLEMENTED / VERIFYING

### Global God's-eye grid
- native-WebGL planetary latitude/longitude grid;
- real-coordinate world city nodes;
- orbit, zoom, point selection and city focus;
- explicit operator-triggered city descent;
- live OpenStreetMap Overpass building footprints;
- building-height extraction and metric projection;
- interactive 3D wireframe city extrusion;
- provider attribution and cached requests;
- explicit fallback labeling when live geometry is unavailable.

### Operator profile
- editable profile dialog;
- persistent local JSON store;
- browser cache fallback;
- client-side avatar resize;
- bounded avatar/profile payloads;
- no profile field grants infrastructure authority.

### Quantum compute
- credential-free local Sampler fallback;
- IBM Cloud IAM token exchange;
- IBM Quantum backend discovery;
- OpenQASM 3 editor;
- Sampler V2 job submission;
- remote job listing and job detail retrieval;
- job/evidence receipts;
- explicit separation between hardware submission and completed QPU execution.

### Next expansion
- configurable commercial/self-hosted geospatial providers for higher-volume deployments;
- vector road/transmission overlays and terrain/elevation;
- progressive globe-to-city camera interpolation instead of the current workspace transition;
- IBM job-result visualization and estimator workflows;
- additional quantum providers behind the same adapter contract;
- authenticated multi-user profile/session system for hosted deployments.

## Batch 9 — Global grid intelligence and shared agent context

Status: IMPLEMENTED / VERIFYING

### Arbitrary coordinate exploration
- operator-entered latitude/longitude;
- bounded 250 m–2 km local radius;
- custom coordinate nodes injected into the live globe session;
- animated globe-to-coordinate descent;
- same interactive city WebGL renderer used by preset cities.

### Real mapped grid layers
- live OpenStreetMap building footprints;
- live road topology;
- live mapped power line / minor-line / cable geometry;
- live mapped substation / plant / generator / transformer assets;
- independent BUILDINGS / ROADS / POWER GRID / ASSET NODES controls;
- power metadata such as voltage, circuits and operator preserved when present;
- deterministic local fallback power topology for standalone/offline mode;
- visible source attribution and fallback state.

### 4D city review
- city renderer retains x/y/z geometry plus time-phase animation;
- GLOBAL workspace exposes a dedicated 24-hour time index;
- time affects spatial animation without altering source provenance.

### Shared agent context
- last loaded geospatial summary becomes bounded AI context;
- last quantum submission/result state becomes bounded AI context;
- individual agents and team synthesis receive the same external-context envelope;
- credentials, bearer tokens, and actuation authority never enter that envelope.

### Verification requirements
- parser tests cover OSM buildings, roads, power lines and power assets;
- custom coordinate validation is tested;
- standalone fallback contains buildings, roads and power topology;
- HTML/app manifests advertise the new controls and routes;
- ZIP assembly fails if coordinate or power-grid controls disappear;
- release-readiness fails if the live power parser, coordinate endpoint, or agent context disappears.

### Next expansion
- terrain/elevation provider adapter;
- transmission/asset relationship graph inference from source topology;
- weather/renewables overlays behind separately attributed adapters;
- hosted multi-user authentication/session boundary;
- additional quantum providers behind the provider-neutral runtime;
- richer quantum result charts and estimator workflows.
